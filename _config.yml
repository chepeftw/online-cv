summary: 'I am a Principal DevOps Engineer with a Ph.D. in Computer Science, specializing in decentralized and distributed monitoring of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). My career has bridged development and infrastructure, giving me a robust foundation in both areas and leading me to specialize in DevOps.

My expertise spans a wide range of technologies, including Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and various cloud platforms like AWS, GCE, and Azure. I am proficient in languages such as Go, Java, PHP, and Python.

I have worked globally, including in Guatemala, Mexico, the Caribbean, USA, Canada, and Europe. My academic journey includes a B.S. in Computer Science, an M.S. in IT with a focus on computer networks and information security, and a Ph.D. from Telecom SudParis in France.

I am proactive, responsible, and passionate about technology, continuously seeking to expand my knowledge and adapt to new challenges with a positive and committed approach.'
