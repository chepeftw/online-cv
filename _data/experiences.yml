- experience:
  role: Scientific Researcher
  time: 2015 - Present
  company: Telecom SudParis, France
  details: "I work doing research in the topic of distributed systems, monitoring and mobile ad-hoc networks.
  My main foucs has been to propose novel solutions and approaches to provide efficient monitoring techniques for MANETs.
  This implies taking into account the properties of this networks as mobility, availability, node range and others.
  I have extensive experience defining mathematical models and tools to model the proposals. 
  Along this I have developed multiple tools like a NS3 Docker Emulator, which is a flexible network emulator relying on NS3 and Docker to run the code to be emulated.
  Through this tool, I have designed other frameworks for monitoring focusing on decentralized and distributed architectures, which have been developed in Java and GoLang.
  Aside from that, I have integrated the emulator and my proposals with an AWS orchestrator that I built to provide thousands of experiments and data in a short time frame.
  Together, I have been able to generate a lot of data, then store it in a MongoDB and later run analysis on the data to be finally presented in publications.
  All this tools and code can be found in my Github profile."
