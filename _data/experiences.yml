  details: "I work as a freelancer in my free time developing web systems or providing consulting for infrastructure.
  I have a strong focus on web systems which I have worked with PHP and Symfony (from version 1.1 to 4).
  I have designed web systems focused on health, where there are interfaces for doctors and patients.
  For other companies, I have also worked on administrative tools, mainly companies that want to digitalize multiple processes and keep a better track of their work.
  These tools range from volunteering organizations, state-branches offices and exporting companies from Guatemala and Mexico.
  In the beginning, I worked directly with PHP, MySQL and Apache on a bare metal servers, 
  but in the last years I have moved all my infrastructure practices to PaaS (Docker) and IaaS (Docker Swarm and Kubernetes).
  I try to work as modular as possible, in the sense that the development follows the best practices of the moment 
  as using Docker for scalability and having everything as a microservice, relying on minimal containers running in Alpine.
  I also have worked in smaller websites based on Jekyll and static HTML.
  Finally, I have done infrastructure consulting for GPS-services companies for Linux and Windows architecture. "
- experience:
  role: Scientific Researcher
  time: 2015 - 2018
  company: Telecom SudParis, France
  details: "I work doing research on the topic of distributed systems, monitoring, and mobile ad-hoc networks.
  My primary focus has been to propose novel solutions and approaches to provide efficient monitoring techniques for MANETs.
  I've focused on decentralized (inspired by gossip and hierarchical algorithms) and distributed (inspired in blockchain) approaches.
  This implies taking into account the properties of this networks as mobility, availability, node range, and others.
  I have extensive experience defining mathematical models and tools to model the proposals. 
  Along with this, I have developed multiple tools like a NS3 Docker Emulator, which is a flexible network emulator relying on NS3 and Docker to run the code to be emulated.
  Through this tool, I have designed other frameworks for monitoring focusing on decentralized and distributed architecture, which have been developed in Java and GoLang.
  Aside from that, I have integrated the emulator and my proposals with an AWS orchestrator that I built to provide thousands of experiments and data in a short time frame.
  Together, I have been able to generate a lot of data, then store it in a MongoDB and later run the analysis on the data to be finally presented in publications.
  All these tools and code can be found on my Github profile."
